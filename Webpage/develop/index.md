# Projection and clustering tutorial

Welcome! This page lives in [its github repository](https://github.com/SamueleSoraggi/Projection_and_clustering_tutorial), where code, slides and data mentioned in this page can be found. Under `Assignment` you find the exercise, `Datasets` shows you which data I gathered for the class, but you can use any dataset you like, while `Code` contains various examples and the book's tSNE code.  The slides from the presentation [are here in both PDF and PPTX format](https://github.com/SamueleSoraggi/Projection_and_clustering_tutorial/tree/main/Slides). You can recycle them and just mention the original author.
