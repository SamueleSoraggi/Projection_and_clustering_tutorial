# Projection and clustering tutorial

Hello! To run this tutorial and assignment you need to call these packages in `R`, so make sure you install al of them:

```
library(dbscan)
library(ggplot2)
library(MASS)
library(FactoMineR)
library(repr)
library(scatterplot3d)
library(uwot)
library(kernlab)
library(microbenchmark)

Under `Assignment` you find the assignments.
Under `Code` there is an example of code for the assignment using the Iris data.
